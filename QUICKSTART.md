# SafeHarbor Quick Start Guide

Get SafeHarbor up and running on your Raspberry Pi in under 15 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi 3B+ or newer
- MicroSD card with Raspberry Pi OS installed
- Power supply
- Internet connection (for initial setup)

## 1. Download SafeHarbor

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/safeharbor.git
cd safeharbor
```

Or download and extract the ZIP file:

## 2. Install

Run the automated installation script:

```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

The script will:
- Install all required dependencies
- Set up directories and permissions
- Build the application
- Create and start the system service

Installation takes 5-10 minutes depending on your Pi model.

## 3. Access SafeHarbor

Once installation is complete, find your Raspberry Pi's IP address:

```bash
hostname -I
```

Open a browser on any device connected to the same network and navigate to:

```
http://YOUR_PI_IP:3000
```

Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`

## 4. First Login

## Quick Tips

### Recommended First Downloads

**Small ZIM Libraries** (good for testing):
- Simple English Wikipedia (~200MB)
- TED Talks (~10GB)
- Stack Overflow (~50GB)

**Larger Collections** (when you have space):
- Full Wikipedia English (~95GB)
- Khan Academy (~7GB)
- Project Gutenberg (~15GB)

### Performance Tips

- **Raspberry Pi 3**: Keep connected devices under 10
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: Can handle 20+ devices
- **Use USB 3.0 SSD** for better performance with large libraries
- **Enable cooling** if serving many users simultaneously

### Storage Management

Check disk space:

```bash
df -h
```

Recommended storage:
- **32GB SD Card**: Basic usage, small ZIM files
- **128GB SD Card**: Multiple ZIM files, moderate content
- **External SSD**: Best option for large libraries

## Common First-Time Issues

### Can't access web interface

**Problem**: Browser shows "Can't connect"

**Solutions**:
1. Verify SafeHarbor is running: `sudo systemctl status safeharbor`
2. Check firewall: `sudo ufw status` (should be inactive or allow port 3000)
3. Use IP address instead of hostname
4. Wait 1-2 minutes after starting service

### Hotspot not broadcasting

**Problem**: Can't find SafeHarbor Wi-Fi network

**Solutions**:
1. Check wireless interface: `ip link show wlan0`
2. View hostapd status: `sudo systemctl status hostapd`
3. Ensure no other network managers are running
4. Try manual network restart: `sudo systemctl restart safeharbor`

### Downloads failing

**Problem**: ZIM downloads fail or timeout

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you're in Home Network Mode (not Hotspot)
2. Check internet connection: `ping google.com`
3. Verify disk space: `df -h`
4. Try downloading smaller files first
